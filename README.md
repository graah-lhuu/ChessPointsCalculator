# ChessPointsCalculator
I was learning chess recently, and I discovered each pieces have different values.  
queen 9 points  
rook 5  
bishop and knight 3  
pawn 1  
If we add them together, we can see which player gains advantages.  
So useless is this program that you can easily calculate the total materials by your self,  
and you certainly cannot use this program during competition.
